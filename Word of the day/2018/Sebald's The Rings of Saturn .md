## A reading group of Sebald's The Rings of Saturn

Robert Macfarlane:

ICYMI: a reading group of Sebald's The Rings of Saturn will be running here from 9 July to 2 Aug. 
I'll post questions every day or two. Find a copy in your language; I'll use Michael Hulse's fine
trans. Discussions underway here & via hashtags. Join us!
